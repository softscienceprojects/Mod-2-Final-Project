# Welcome to BetterThanTelly!

This app will allow you to sign up to see events, create events and venues, attend events and get recommendations for upcoming events you may be interested in, based off your past behaviour with the app.

## Try it out
See it in action at [https://betterthantelly.herokuapp.com/].
You can either sign up or use the test account `e@e.com` - password: `e`.

## User stories
See events in categories and per venue. 

Sign up to create a user profile and log in and out to the app.

After you have 'attended' an event, and the event is in the past, you are prompted to create a review which will influence what is recommended to you. After you write a review, only you as the author are able to edit it. 

If you host an event, you will see reviews once they are left for the events you put on. As the host, you can also edit the event after initial creation.
